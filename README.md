🔥 This repo provides the LICENSEs used in oxygen-OSS Projects.
Oxygen-OSS (Oxygen Open Source Software) is an Organization that provides users with Anti-Commercial and Custom LICENSEs used across Oxygen-OSS projects. Unlike most open-source licenses that allow corporate greed and exploitation, our licenses focus on **user-sovereignity**.

## 🎯 Our Philosophy
**Oxygen-OSS Creates FOSS/FLOSS software** by **traditional definitions, not the ones forced on by organizations like OSI that allow corporate exploitation.**

## ❓ The "Why?"
- **Kindness** - Built with Love ❤️
- **Community Protection** - We try to prevent *enshittification* of Software built **by the Community, for the Community**.
- **We hate Corporate Greed** - We think Corporate Greed *enshittifies* Software.

## Licenses

- Oxygen Public License 1.0

## ✅ We thrive to protect
- **User privacy** - by creating Software that is Open Source, banning "Black Box Software")
- **Community Efforts** - by making the Software Free **(as in Freedom and Beer)**
- **Your Wallet** - by ending the loophole where Open Source Software become a **mandatory** price of a House.
